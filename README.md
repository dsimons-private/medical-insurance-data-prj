## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
Digital Health and Big data are transforming the healthcare sector.
With this project, I want to do my first steps in data science to check, which health insights can be gained by insurace data

The following questions shall be answered:

1. Which factors contribute the most reagring medical costs?
2. Can anything be said about the state of health of the residents from the data for the individual regions?
3. Is it possible to predict health insurance costs from the given features?
